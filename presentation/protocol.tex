  \frametitle{Deployment}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item On startup, a node begins listening for a deployment brodcast
  \item The sink node has the option to begin broadcasting the deployment message
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[--] Must also set the maximum number of nodes in the network
    \end{itemize}
  \item A new node is turned on and is travelled in a straight line until it is signalled to be deployed based on packet loss or the rssi
  \item The node then sends the stop signal to it's parent and begins deploying itself
  \item If the node is the final node, it will send the stop signal and begin transmitting data to the sink node
    
  \end{enumerate}
